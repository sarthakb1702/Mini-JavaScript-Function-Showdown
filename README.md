# COSC Commit Counter

The CBIT Open Source Community (COSC) Commit Counter is a simple web tool to simulate tracking the number of commits (PRs) made during HackWeek. It displays a counter starting from 0, and provides buttons to increment, decrement, or reset the count.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Increment**: Simulates a new commit being made.
- **Decrement**: Simulates reverting a commit (count does not go below 0).
- **Reset**: Resets the counter to 0 (e.g., at the end of the day).
